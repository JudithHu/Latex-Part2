\emph{Euclidean geometry (page \pageref{euclidean-axioms}):}\\\label{euclidean-summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item[E1] Two points determine a line.
\item[E2] Line segments can be extended.
\item[E3] A unique circle can be constructed given any point as its center and any line segment as its radius.
\item[E4] All right angles are equal to one another.
\item[E5] \emph{Parallel postulate:} Given a line and a point not on the line, exactly one line
          can be drawn through the point and parallel to the given line.\footnote{This is a form known as Playfair's axiom, rather than the version of the
                   postulate originally given by Euclid.}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Ordered geometry (page \pageref{ordered-geometry-axioms}):}\\\label{ordered-summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item[O1] Two events determine a line.
\item[O2] Line segments can be extended: given A and B, there is at least one event such that [ABC] is true.
\item[O3] Lines don't wrap around: if [ABC] is true, then [BCA] is false.
\item[O4] Betweenness: For any three distinct events A, B, and C lying on the same line, we can determine whether or not B is between A and C (and by statement 3, this ordering is unique except for a possible over-all reversal to form [CBA]).
\end{itemize}

\emph{Affine geometry (page \pageref{affine-axioms}):}\\\label{affine-summary}
In addition to O1-O4, postulate the following axioms:
\begin{itemize}
\item[A1] Constructibility of parallelograms: Given any P, Q, and R, there exists S such that [PQRS], and if P, Q, and R are distinct then S is unique.
\item[A2] Symmetric treatment of the sides of a parallelogram: If [PQRS], then [QRSP], [QPSR], and [PRQS].
\item[A3] Lines parallel to the same line are parallel to one another: If [ABCD] and [ABEF], then [CDEF].
\end{itemize}

\emph{Experimentally motivated statements about Lorentzian geometry (page \pageref{lorentz-geometry-postulates}):}\\\label{lorentz-summary}
\begin{itemize}\label{lorentz-geometry-postulates}
\item[L1] \emph{Spacetime is homogeneous and isotropic.} No point has special properties that make it distinguishable from other points, nor is one
                  direction distinguishable from another.
\item[L2] \emph{Inertial frames of reference exist.} These are frames in which particles move at constant velocity if not subject to any forces.
                  We can construct such a frame by using a particular particle, which is not subject to any forces, as a reference point.
\item[L3] \emph{Equivalence of inertial frames:} If a frame is in constant-velocity translational motion relative to an inertial frame, then it is also an inertial frame.
              No experiment can distinguish one inertial frame from another.
\item[L4] \emph{Causality:} There exist events 1 and 2 such that $t_1<t_2$ in all frames. 
\item[L5] \emph{Relativity of time:} There exist events 1 and 2 and frames of reference
        $(t,x)$ and $(t',x')$ such that $t_1<t_2$, but $t'_1>t'_2$.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Statements of the equivalence principle:}\\\label{equivalence-principle-summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Accelerations and gravitational fields are equivalent. There is no experiment that can distinguish one from
the other (page \pageref{equivalence-a-and-g}).
\item[] It is always possible to define a \emph{local} Lorentz
frame in a particular neighborhood of spacetime (page \pageref{equivalence-locally-lorentzian}).
\item[] There is no way to associate a preferred tensor field with spacetime (page \pageref{equivalence-no-preferred-field}).
\end{itemize}

\emph{Vectors}\\\label{vec-covec-summary}

\index{vector!summarized}\index{vectors and dual vectors!summarized}
\index{dual vector!summarized}

Coordinates cannot in general be added on a manifold, so they don't form a vector space,
but infinitesimal coordinate differences can and do. The vector space in which the
coordinate differences exist is a different space at every point, referred to as the
tangent space at that point (see p.~\pageref{tangent-space}).

\emph{Vectors} are written in abstract index notation with upper indices, $x^a$, and are
represented by column vectors, arrows, or birdtracks with incoming arrows, $\rightarrow x$.

\emph{Dual vectors}, also known as covectors or 1-forms,
are written in abstract index notation with lower indices, $x_a$, and are represented by row vectors,
ordered pairs of parallel lines (see p.~\pageref{fig:vector-measuring-covector}), or
birdtracks with outgoing arrows, $\leftarrow x$.

In concrete-index notation,
the $x^\mu$ are a list of numbers, referred to as the vector's
contravariant components, while $x_\mu$ would be the covariant components of a dual vector.

Fundamentally the distinction between the two types of vectors is defined by the tensor
transformation laws, p.~\pageref{sec:tensor-transformation-law}. For example, an odometer reading is
contravariant because converting it from kilometers to meters increases it. A temperature
gradient is covariant because converting it from degrees/km to degrees/m decreases it.

In the absence of a metric, every physical quantity has a definite vector or dual vector
character. Infinitesimal coordinate differences $\der x^a$ and velocities $\der x^a/\der\tau$
are vectors, while momentum $p_a$ and force $F_a$ are dual (see
p.~\pageref{eg:momentum-is-lower-index}).
Many ordinary and interesting real-world systems lack a metric
(see p.~\pageref{eg:systems-without-a-metric}).
When a metric is present, we can raise and lower indices at will.
There is a perfect duality symmetry between the two types of vectors, but
this symmetry is broken by the convention that a measurement with a ruler is a
$\Delta x^a$, not a $\Delta x_a$.

For consistency with the transformation laws,
differentiation with respect to a quantity flips the index, e.g., $\partial_{\mu}=\partial/\partial x^\mu$.
The operators $\partial_{\mu}$ are often used as basis vectors for the tangent plane. In general,
expressing vectors in a basis using the Einstein notation convention results in
an ugly notational clash described on p.~\pageref{abuse-of-notation}.
