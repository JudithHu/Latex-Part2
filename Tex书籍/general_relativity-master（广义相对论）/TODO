chapter on symmetries
  static and stationary
  Killing vectors and conserved quantities
  Birkhoff's theorem ?
  No hair theorem

idea
  Kerr metric is infamous for being nasty to derive from scratch.
  Expand it in powers of the angular momentum and try to use the series technique I used for Schw. metric

possible hw
  verify that big bang singularity in Friedmann solutions is a real singularity
        (text claims that R^a_a diverges and sing occurs at finite proper time in past)

understand Rindler metrics better

grav waves
  Should discuss LIGO, etc.
  Should discuss the possible misconception that LIGO can't work because the photons get stretched:
    http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/genrel/ch08/ch08.html#Section8.2 

ch. 5:
  Show that when a particle is dropped from rest at infinity and falls into a black hole, a shell observer (in the sense
  of the Taylor-Wheeler book) at r observes it to have velocity (2M/r)^1/2 as it goes by. To make this a good hw problem,
  I should solve it myself, and make sure I understand all about the shell obvserver.

in section on geodesic eqn, do an example by 2 techniques: (1) geodesic eqn; (2) path ABC, varying B;
         I use technique 2 later in book, should probably use 1

I think my problems with toc are related to use of mytocloft instead of the real tocloft.

ch 4., hw:compton
  could use a figure
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cs137_Spectrum.PNG is goofy, had discriminator set too low, and also has a funky "backscatter" peak in it that I don't
             understand myself

ch. 4 does OOM est of deflection of light; I have more recent notes at http://www.lightandmatter.com/cgi-bin/meki?physics/relativity&section=bending_of_light_rays#bending_of_light_rays
     with some nice qualitative stuff, like Einsteinian versus Newtonian factor of 2 (cf. Newtonian black hole), 2=1+gamma, where gamma is PPN param,
     time delay versus angular deflection, waves versus particles; should also fiddle with deflection.py to get time delay; I'm not totally clear on
     how time delay should be defined

could do Schild's ladder in section on parallel transport

I introduce the frequency four-vector. Rindler has some nice applications to Doppler shifts, etc.

could do Faraday tensor, E&M, etc.; hw: show that force in frame 1 is propto uv, to lowest order (a la SN)

in discussion of four-potential, would be nice to have an example where a charged particle moves through the solenoid's internal region, show that least-action makes sense

in section "The tensor transformation laws", could discuss partial derivative operators as basis for tangent plane; then back-link from frequency four-vector

I need to understand the deeper reasons for this remark in Carroll: "Notice that, unlike the partial derivative, it makes sense to raise an index on the covariant
      derivative, due to metric compatibility." (I just repeated this fact in the book at "With the partial derivative..."

...is it possible to do the analog of the Sch. metric for cylindrical or Cartesian symmetry?

...at sec:more-energy-mom-tensor, should show why this is all true; note that if g is non-diagonal, T with lower indices is non-diagonal, but $T\indices{^\mu_\nu}$ is still diagonal;
        the reason the spatial components are all equal is because we assume a perfect fluid


interesting remark on connecting Riemannian curvature to Gaussian curvature:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_map#Properties_2

WP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_egregium has nice map of globe, interprets impossibility of global orthonormal coords as
           consequence of theorema egregium; I have to think about this more; I've referred to this fact before; put a forward ref to this argument

cosmology applications
  nice example of Ricci versus Weyl curvature: Linder, p. 56, clumpy universe distances
  also surface brightness fluctuations, Linder p. 54, and survey, http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0011223 ; but Linder doesn't explicitly say
          anything about curvature, and neither does the paper; the survey only goes out to .01 redshift; can you do this with deeper fields,
          so that the fluctations count Poisson statistics of galaxies?
  it would be cute to know the actual average numerical value of, say, $R_{xy}$ in our universe

...hw: verify $U^aV_a=U_aV^a$

...pp-waves = plane-fronted with parallel rays; are somewhat more general than plane waves;
    turns out exact pp-waves can be added linearly (which is surprising) in the sense of adding the $H$ function;
