cc  Tony, here is the paper the data come from:
cc  from Quinn et al., Quaternary Science Reviews, Vol. 12 
cc                     pp. 407-418 (1993). 
cc  Input data (paleo1):   year, carb1,carb2,ox1,ox2 
cc              at Santo (Vanuato, 15ÉS-167ÉE)
cc           carb1: change in CARBON13 (minimum of the year)
cc           carb2: change in CARBON13 (maximum of the year)
cc           ox1: change in OXYGEN18 (min)
cc           ox2: change in OXYGEN18 (max)
cc
cc empirically (from comparisons), carbon is correlated with rainfalls
cc                                 Oxygen is correlated with SST
cc                SST=-4.46 (ox) + 5.29
cc    (correlation  r= 0.77 with available observed SST)
cc  
cc              not given for carbon13-Raifalls
cc  otherwise correlation r=0.81 so the change in Carbon can be assimilated
cc  as rainfalls (the relation is supposed linear between rainfalls and CARB)
cc
cc    
cc  IMOY:  0 input data taken (2 data/year, min and max of the year)
cc         1 year average (average on 2 values: not really meaningfull)
cc   IFILT:  1 apply Hanning filter
cc   NTAU is the delay time (Procaccia & Gassberger) ntau=2 : one year
