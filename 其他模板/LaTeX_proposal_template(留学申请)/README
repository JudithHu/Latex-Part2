This LaTeX template was created by John A Stevenson (twitter: volcan01010) to help people preparing grant applications or any other documents where space is limited.

Once all files have been unzipped, the source should compile with the following commands:

pdflatex proposal_template
bibtex proposal_template
pdflatex proposal_template
pdflatex proposal_template

The necessary packages can be installed on Ubuntu-based Linux systems with the following command:

sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra \ texlive-humanities texlive-fonts-extra

Enjoy.
