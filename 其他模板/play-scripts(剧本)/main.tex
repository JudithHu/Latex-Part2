    \item[] I need scarcely add that the circumstance alluded to was the withdrawing of the piece to remove those imprefections which were too obvious to escape reprehension.
    
    \item[] With regard to some particular passages which seemed generally disliked, I confess that if I felt any emotion of surprise at the disapprobation, it was not that they were disapproved of, but that I had not before perceived that they deserved it.
