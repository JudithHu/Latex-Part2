  I am a 4 1/2 year old Coton de Tulear and have been team mascot for
  two years. I am a wonderful distraction. I take seriously my job,
  doing my best to make everyone smile. In fact, my name, Mitsiky, means
  "My Smile" in Malagasy. My favorite hobbies are visiting chipmunk
  holes, playing tug-of-war with my toy bunny, and just being cute. \vspace{3mm} \\

  My goal this year is to earn my credential as a Therapy Dog so that I
  can participate in the team’s outreach and make everyone feel good by
  flashing my warm smile. Also, I hope to finally catch a squirrel.
