This is the standard class file for Princeton University Press books. To use it, simply invoke the pupbook class with desired options, such as

\documentclass[7x10,oldfontcommands]{pupbook}

This will give you the default PUP design. Your editor will provide you with any commands specific to your individual book, if any. 

If you have any problems with the class file, contact Steve Peter at speter@mac.com. In your correspondence, please provide the type of TeX installation you are running, the operating system, and any other relevant details.
